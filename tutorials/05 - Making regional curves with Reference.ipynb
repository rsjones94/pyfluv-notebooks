    "# Making regional curves with the Reference class\n",
    "\n",
    "## About regional curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Many restoration practitioners, regulators and academics look to unimpacted streams to inform their understanding of a what it means for an arbitrary stream to be \"functioning\". Evaluators collect information (such as bankfull width, depth, area and discharge) for a number of reference reaches and group the reaches together, often by EPA ecoregion. If enough reference reaches are evaluated, a curve of best fit (sometimes referred to as a \"regional curve\") can be made that relates the drainage area of a stream and an idea bankfull attribute. This curve is usually expected to follow the form $y = ax^b$, where $y$ is the drainage area and $x$ is an arbitrary bankfull attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Reference` class has just two arguments: `reaches` and `eco`. `reaches` is a pandas dataframe that, at the minimum, has a column of drainage areas (which *must* have 'drain' somewhere in its column name) and one more numeric column. Typically it should have columns for bankfull area, width, mean depth and discharge. `eco` is just an integer or string that indicates what area the `Reference` object will represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EPA Ecoregion 71\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyfluv includes a sample `Reference` object representing ecoregion 71, which covers most of middle Tennessee and is where the West Piney river mitigation project is. Like with `GrainDistributions`, pyfluv does not offer a bespoke class for importing reference data since it is simple enough to read in a csv. You can view the csv that pyfluv reads in for ecoregion 71 [here](https://github.com/rsjones94/pyfluv/blob/master/pyfluv/Data/eco71.csv). Many states issue reports on reference reaches; the data included in pyfluv was transcribed from a (TDEC report)[https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/environment/water/documents/wr_wq_regional-curves-ecoregion711.pdf]. Note that TDEC has included their own regional curve equations. These may differ slightly from those generated by `Reference` objects due to differences in implementation."
